                    <br>
                     <p class="info" id="beginningsDesc">Hogwarts was founded by four wizards and witches: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. It became a boarding school for many other wizards and witches willing to learn the many ways or magic. The school is over a thousand years old, and it is located a few hours from London, England. These four founders represented the personality traits of the houses that students got assigned to. There was, however, a quarrel concerning if muggles or half-bloods could attend the school. Salazar was set on keeping the school for pure-bloods, while the others thought otherwise. Before he left the school, he eventually built the Chamber of Secrets, where only his own heir would be able to gain entry and unleash a basilisk, or the Serpent of Slytherin, to get rid of all muggle-born and half-blood students. Naturally, Godric and Salazar were friends no longer, as Godric believed that all students - including muggles and half-bloods - should be given a chance to learn magic if they were capable of learning.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p class="info" id="chamberDesc">Twice, Hogwarts was threatened to close down due to certain issues concerning the Chamber of Secrets that Salazar made many years ago. The first time it was opened since then was when one of the heirs decided to take a look. This person's name is Tom Riddle, later known as the antaonist of the series, Voldemort. When Myrtle Waren died, the school was threatened to be closed down, Tom Riddle was in a muggle orphanage at the time, and he didn't want the school closed down. Aside from that, the fact that he was denied permission to stay in the school during the holidays because of what he did made him accuse Hagrid. Dumbledore had his suspicions, but Tom Riddle got away with it. He was free of accusation until the late 1900's, when the Chamber reopened again. At that time, he was found guilty, and Hagrid was free from suspicion. Harry Potter had been in the school already when Hagrid was found innocent.</p>

                    <p id="modernDesc" class="info">Harry entered Hogwarts in 1991, and for the first time, he learned of his potential as a wizard. Known as the one who fought off Voldemort, he was quite famous among many wizards and witches. He met Ron and Hermione when he was accepted to Gryffindor, although if he had not met Draco Malfoy, he would have ended up in Slytherin. Together, the trio uncover certain mysteries about the school in their search for the Philosopher's Stone that was being being kept at the school. When they found the Chamber of Secrets, they met up with a certain professor at the end of the chamber, who was Quirinus Quirrell. They discovered that he was being controlled by Voldemort, who at the time was barely alive, to retrieve the Philosopher's Stone for himself. Harry fought him and foiled Voldemort's plans, making him retreat for the time being. This act of bravery was one that definitely resembled the Gryffindors, making this house the most suitable house for Harry.</p>
